# HelloMinecraftMods
This is my first Minecraft mod. I'm following [Getting Started with Add-On Development for Bedrock Edition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/gettingstarted).

<br>

## Features
1. Green dirt ([Introduction to Resource Packs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/resourcepack))
2. Mad cows ([Introduction to Behavior Packs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/behaviorpack)) that attack and provide extra drops
3. `.gitignore` for Minecraft-Bedrock mods
